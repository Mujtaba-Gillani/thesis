The aim of my thesis is "Does financial constraint influence the post-acquisition dynamics of firms, and if so, how? A comprehensive analysis of financially constrained firms completing takeovers, considering the impact on investments, cash flows, innovation activities (including patent applications and value), and operating performance, with a focus on the three years following the acquisition." In order to acheive this I am trying to replicate a dataset froma resource material paper. This paper has a similar research question to mine and hence i choose this paper's data setup and initial methodology to recreate. The analysis is conducted by a fixed effects regression with interaction terms and needs to have robustness checks for validity.
